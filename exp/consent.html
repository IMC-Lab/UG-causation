<p align="left"><strong>Key Information:</strong> This consent form asks you to take part in a research study. The study is being conducted by Felipe De Brigard, PhD., associate professor at the Department of Philosophy, the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, and the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Purpose:</strong> This research study seeks to help us understand the ways in which our experiences inform our causal judgments.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>What you will be asked to do:</strong> This research study consists of one session. You will be asked to play a short game where you split a sum of money, and then answer a few questions about the game you played. You will also be asked for your demographic information. The total time for participating in this research study is expected to take between 30 and 90 minutes. You will be paid at a prorated rate of $14/hour, with the opportunity of earning a bonus of up to $10. Participation in this study is voluntary, and you can stop at any time without penalty, but you will only receive any bonus payments if you complete the study. </p>

<p align="left"><strong>How your confidentiality will be maintained:</strong> If you choose to participate, your name will not be linked to your responses at any time, and there is no link between this consent form and your responses. All data will be securely saved at all times. All data we keep will be de-identified, indefinitely.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Future Use of Data:</strong> Your de-identified data (data without your name), together with de-identified data from other participants in the experiment, might be made publicly available, will be shared with other researchers as a requirement of publication and funding, and might be used for future research purposes.</p>
